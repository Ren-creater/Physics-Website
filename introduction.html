<p class="l">Light, the carrier of all the information that we've seen from the universe. Even though the light itself is not visible, but we perceive an object by our eyes capturing the light reflected on the object.</p>
<p class=”I”>&ensp;It might be surprising to learn that light has a mass of 0, and that is the reason that the speed of light is the fastest speed in our universe, and it is even now supposed to be the limit of how fast we can travel.</p>
<p class="l">&ensp;Light could not only tell us about the universe at this moment, but also its past. Looking at the night sky, amid the billions of stars in the sky, some of the stars have already “died” long time ago and therefore ceased emitting light for their “fuels”were used up, but the light they emitted in the past will still remain in our sky long after they have vanished, because they are too far away, it even takes the light billions of years to reach our eyes.</p>
<p class="l">&ensp;Light is such a fascinating thing. But, do you know the visible light is just a  small portion of the electro spectrum?</p>
<p>&ensp;Light is regarded as a wave, but after Einstein, it had also been discovered that light is composed of small particles called "photons". This discovery revealed the dual nature of the universe, that all the matters in the universe can be regarded as two forms, waves and particles, even though this is a confusing fact, but this is the base of modern physics, or quantum mechanics.</p>
<p class=”I”>&ensp;Unfortunately, we will not be covering the facts above in our content. Instead, we will learn the basic facts about the physics about light, that is what you have learned or will be learning in high school.</p>
